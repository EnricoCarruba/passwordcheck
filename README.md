# Password Check

This was one of my coding katas at Coding Bootcamps Europe. It checks the entered password if it is:

- equal
- contains lower case
- upper case
- numbers
- at least 10 characters.

In addition the password can be hidden on shown with a toggle button.

The "contains number" check doesnt work correctly yet, there is an issue with the regex i still have to fix.
